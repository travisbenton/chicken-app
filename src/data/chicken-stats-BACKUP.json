    "description": "The Ameraucana breed was derived from blue egg-laying chickens, but they do not have the breeding problems inherent to Araucanas. In addition, rather than ear tufts, they have muffs and a beard, and are very hardy and sweet. They lay eggs in shades of blue, and even have blue (or \"slate\") legs. Less rare than Araucanas, they are still quite rare and only available through breeders at this time. They should not be confused with Easter Eggers, which can lay blue and green eggs, and do not conform to any breed standard. However, many hatcheries continue to call their Easter Eggers \"Americanas\" (and other various misspellings). If you are interested in showing your birds, make sure that you have true Ameraucana or Araucana.",

In addition, the tufts often aren't symmetrical, even in purebred Araucanas. For these reasons, Araucanas are only available through breeders at this time, and not hatcheries. This breed is most famous for laying blue-shelled eggs. They should not be confused with Easter Eggers, which can lay blue and green eggs, and do not conform to any breed standard.

Because they don't have much insulation, they don't do especially well in drafty cold, even though their small pea combs are not usually subject to frostbite. Most chicken meat bought in US supermarkets comes from a White Cornish x White Plymouth Rock cross. Because the poor crosses were bred to be confined, they're not the best pets, and the crosses suffer from a variety of skeletal and heart problems due to their fast growth, poor things! (For healthier meat birds we would recommend looking for the new hybrid usually referred to as the \"Colored Ranger\") The regular Cornish don't suffer from the same health problems the Cornish Crosses do. Nonetheless, Cornish are still not especially good foragers, nor are they usually very active birds in general. We're told they can make great lap chickens and have a gentle nature, even though they are large, heavy and look fierce. They tend to be on the lower end of the pecking order in mixed flocks despite their size.",

Easter Eggers vary widely in color and conformation and are exceptionally friendly and hardy. Since they are usually quite friendly to children and humans in general, they are a great choice for a family flock. Most hatcheries mistakenly label their Easter Eggers as Ameraucanas or Araucanas (or various misspellings thereof). True Ameraucanas and Araucanas are currently only available through breeders. Easter Eggers do not qualify to be shown since they do not conform to a breed standard.",

Favaucanas are the Goldendoodles of the chicken world: They have the sweet disposition and beautiful plumage of the Faverolles, along with the lovely colored eggs and extra cold hardiness of the Ameraucanas. These beauties get the best of both worlds! Purebred Faverolles can often get bullied by other breeds in a mixed flock, but by contrast, Favaucanas fare much better in the pecking order, seemingly getting boost of self-confidence from their Ameraucana heritage. They have the excellent laying abilities from their Faverolles halves, too, and their sagey green eggs are just gorgeous! They're wonderful foragers. Plus, Favaucanas mature earlier and inherit the good winter laying capabilities of their Faverolles half. What's not to love?",

Roosters are huge and magnificent, parading around with a virtual rainbow of colors: iridescent black where the hens are white, burnished with bronze on their backs and wings, while their hackles and saddles the color of pale straw. Faverolles roosters are particularly calm and dignified, and make great roosters for the home flock since they are not as aggressive as some others. The hens lay medium-sized light brown or creamy eggs in prolific numbers, and they are good winter layers, too. They are shy and sweet-natured, but so docile that they tend to find themselves at the bottom of the pecking order in a mixed flock.",

They are also one of the most early maturing of chicken breeds: hens can begin laying eggs as early as 4-1/2 or 5 months! This breed is known to be naturally resistant to Marek's Disease and to many other illnesses. However, they are normally fairly nervous in temperament, and can be feather pickers if they don't have enough room. They can be territorial about their favorite nesting spots, and roosters are noisy. They are also fliers, so are not always the best choice for a backyard flock since they can and will clear most fences. With plenty of room, however, they can be a good choice for a small farm, since they are good foragers, economical eaters, independent, tough, aware of their surroundings and good at avoiding predators.",

Though they tolerate confinement, they're most happy when they get to range freely. All varieties of Plymouth Rock aside from the Barred and White varieties are relatively rare.",

They are tame but their behavior can be a bit wacky since their crest limits their vision. When in a flock with more aggressive breeds, Polish will tend to be on the low end of the pecking order. Egg laying is varied in this breed - some lay well and some very poorly. In short, Polish are sweet, beautiful exhibition birds and can be good layers in the backyard flock, but they're not reliable.",

They've been chic ever since the sultans of Ottoman Empire would keep them in their gardens. The one pictured below is molting - normally their crests are fuller. They are wonderful for show, because their \"attire\" is so impressive and outlandish. They're also very calm birds--on the show floor this translates to \"easier for poultry judges to handle.\"",

They have been known variously as \"Sumatran Pheasants\" or \"Java Pheasant Game Birds,\" even though they are most definitely chickens! Their unique carriage, with their sweeping tails held low, gives them the air of a pheasant or peacock, however. Sumatras make great show birds, and they're usually kept for their beauty alone. This is no surprise, because they're usually poor layers and they aren't hefty enough to be a good meat bird. You can see from the photos that their shiny, lustrous feathers are striking, but in addition they're one of two breeds of chicken whose roosters have multiple spurs! Like the Silkie, they also have black skin and black bones.",

Friendly and curious, Super Blues are prolific layers of large, blue-tinted eggs, averaging five to six eggs a week, even during the heat of summer. Typically, Super Blue hens begin laying at 22-24 weeks of age. Bear in mind that they tend to be broody! On average, 15/16 pullets will lay blue eggs when they mature. Because these are first generation crosses (F1), statistically, 1 out of 16 Super Blue eggs will produce a chicken with a single comb (as opposed to the usual pea comb) who will not lay blue eggs. Please also keep in mind that your blue eggs may be anywhere from pale blue-hued to a more intense, aqua blue. There is no chicken to our knowledge that lays sky-blue eggs!",

In England, they used to be THE standard table bird, before the modern Cornish Crosses came along. They forage well and are economical eaters that are friendly and easily handled. Their curious nature means they will often follow you around the yard if they think they can beg a treat from you.The \"speckled\" variety has plumage that gives them some camouflage from predators, too. Many tend to get more speckles after each successive molt, so they just get prettier with age. Seriously, what more could you ask for in a chicken?",
